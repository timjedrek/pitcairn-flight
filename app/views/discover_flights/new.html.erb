      The Discovery Flight experience is specially crafted to provide you with a glimpse into the world of aviation. You will spend around 30-60 minutes airborne alongside one of our certified flight instructors, who will walk you through the fundamentals of flying and address any questions you might have. Additionally, you'll have the chance to take the controls and fly the airplane yourself.

A Discovery Flight is a must do if you are contemplating a career in aviation, looking for a new pastime, or seeking a unforgettable gift. Following the flight, the instructor will be available to address any questions you may have during the post flight briefing.
